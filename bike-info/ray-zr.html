            Yamaha Motor India created a niche for itself in the Honda Activa-dominated 110c scooter segment by
            introducing the Ray ZR Street Rally over two years ago. The scooter was pitched as a product that can go off
            the beaten path. Now, the scooter has received an upgrade to comply with the BS6 emission norms, and during
            the transition, Yamaha has also bumped up the displacement and gave it a styling revision to make it even
            more appealing. The only direct rival to the scooter is the new Aprilia Storm 125, although the Yamaha
            product is more affordable. We tested the Yamaha Ray ZR Street Rally, and here is our road test review about
            the scooter.
