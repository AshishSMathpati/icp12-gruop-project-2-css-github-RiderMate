            This is the new Hero Xtreme 250R, the first motorcycle based on Heroâ€™s new 250cc platform. It was launched
            at Bharat Mobility Expo in January and competes against the likes of the Bajaj Pulsar N250 and the Suzuki
            Gixxer 250. If you overlook the steep Rs. 47,000 price difference, the Xtreme also locks horns with the KTM
            250 Duke in terms of engine specifications and body style.
