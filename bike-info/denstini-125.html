            After almost 14 years of existence, Hero MotoCorp decided to give a major facelift to the Pleasure. It’s now
            called the Pleasure Plus and gets some big aesthetic and mechanical updates because ‘Why should boys have
            all the fun?’ Thanks to its compact design and lightweight – the Pleasure was the first choice for girls who
            were entering the world of two-wheel commuting. But the lack of newness and old design resulted in decrease
            sales and brand recall. So the new Pleasure Plus has been launched to address the concerns of the new world.
