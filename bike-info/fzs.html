            Apart from a long name, the new Yamaha FZ-S FI Version 4.0 Deluxe comes with more features than the standard
            variant of the 150cc roadster-segment motorcycle. These include a revised front fascia, an updated
            instrument cluster, more electronic rider aids, and OBD2 and E20 fuel compliance. We tested this motorcycle
            for a comprehensive road test review to find out how well does the updated package work. Here, we explain
            the design, performance, fuel efficiency, ride quality, and more of the new Yamaha FZ-S FI Version 4.0
            Deluxe. And as always, we will start with the design of this motorcycle.
