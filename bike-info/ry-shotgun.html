            Royal Enfield expanded its 650cc line-up with the Super Meteor 650, which is a proper cruiser and also their
            most expensive bike to date. This bike has managed to cater to a set of buyers who have been wanting to go
            cruising but didn’t want to spend more than a million rupees. Now, it’s early 2024 and Royal Enfield has
            once again got us another 650cc motorcycle – the Shotgun 650 – and it is a Bobber. Now, I know you will say
            that it looks similar to the Super Meteor 650, and you are right. However, the Shotgun is a motorcycle that
            is purely positioned as an urban motorcycle.
