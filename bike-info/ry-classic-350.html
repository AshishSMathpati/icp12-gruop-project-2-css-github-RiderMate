            The Royal Enfield Classic 350 is a cruiser that has retro design elements. It features a teardrop-shaped
            fuel tank, round headlamp, and chrome accents that highlight its classic appeal. Powered by a 349cc,
            air-cooled single-cylinder engine, the Classic 350 delivers 20.2 bhp and 27 Nm of peak torque. The engine is
            paired with a five-speed manual transmission, offering smooth and reliable performance. Equipped with
            dual-channel ABS, a semi-digital instrument cluster, and optional alloy wheels, the Classic 350 blends
            heritage styling with modern-day functionality.
